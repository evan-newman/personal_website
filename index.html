                <h3>Hello!</h3>
                <span>Welcome to my lovely page. I am a programmer looking to become the fastest being on Earth to fulfill my dream of becoming
                    sonic the headgehog. Besides being fast I also enjoy speed walking on my off time. Whenever faced with great troubles I've always been able to 
                    pull through such as my tax evasion of '09.

            <h3>Skills</h3>
            <span>Deployed in the gamer wars. I also have many ambitious projects like a fishbowl helmet that act as glasses giving full 360 degree viewing,
                cars that can attach themselves to eachother to provide greater carpooling capabilities, and a pyramid scheme.
